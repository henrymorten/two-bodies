# two-bodies
This is a s imple model of the classical two body problem. Given innitial conditions - such as masses, location, and  velocity, it calculates the motion of the two bodies given that they are viewed as point particles - and the only things in existance. 

### Required packages: 
<ul>
  <li>Numpy: vectorised calculations and array manipulation</li>
  <li>Scipy: numerical integration </li>
  <li>Matplotlib (.pyplot and .animation): For data visualisation</li>
</ul>

There are different methods implemented in order to visualise the two body systems, comment/ un-comment to ajust to suit accordingly.
